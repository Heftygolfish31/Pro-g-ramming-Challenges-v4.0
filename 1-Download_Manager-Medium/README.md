# Download Manager

**Status:** INCOMPLETE

## Description

The very first challenge on our journey is to write a Download Manager. The way I see it in my head is a standalone piece of software that takes a link to a download location on the network and a destination to download it to and does just that.

## Artificial Restraints

- No use of librarys which do what the challenge asks by default.

## Languages

This program has only been written in Python.
