# Pro-g-ramming-Challenges-v4.0
I'm following a 145 challenge path to build my portfolio. Each challenge will be in its own folder marked with the challenge number.

## Stats

**Completion Status:** INCOMPLETE
**Progress:** 0.00%

## The List

I found the list in [exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimiUgDLbi6P17BdaCZpVbg)'s [Discord](https://discord.com/exurb1a) server under the `#Computer-Science` channel. The list itself is an image (found at [this](/thelist.png) part of the repo) with instructions on how to complete the challenges. This list from the image will be copied into a text list (in [this](/thelistsofar.md) part of the repo) for ease of use. Each list item will link to a folder in the repository named to the scheme of `{challenge index}-{challenge name}-{difficulty}`.

## Highlights

Projects from this series I am particularly proud of include:

> None yet, I haven't done any.

### Credit
